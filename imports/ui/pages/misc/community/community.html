        <h2>HealthyLovedOnes (HLO) Community Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
            Last Updated: May 01, 2018
        </p>
        <p>
            At HLO, we’re big on trust and safety. These Community Guidelines help ensure that every HomecareService (HS)is a delightful,
            safe and trusted experience for both our Clients and Caregivers. While we know that these Guidelines may not cover
            every single HS and situation you may encounter, we expect all Caregivers and Clients to act with professionalism
            and in good character to maintain a positive experience for all.
        </p>
        <h3>Community Guidelines for Caregivers</h3>
        <p>
            HLO is your platform to grow your business. To be successful, here are five simple things you can do:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Represent yourself accurately: To be successful on HLO, set accurate criteria for the HS you want to perform, including
                your availability, hourly rate, work area, and HS categories. Please keep this information up-to-date to ensure
                that you receive the most appropriate HS invitations.</li>
            <li>Set clear expectations with your Clients: Surprises are not a good thing when it comes to HS, so please ensure that
                nothing unexpected happens while you’re working on a HS. Be sure to set clear expectations about HS timing, out-of-pocket
                expenses and any other details that are relevant to completing the HS.</li>
            <li>Respond quickly to your Client: HS invitations and communications with your Client are time sensitive. Respond quickly
                and actively manage all Client communications via the chat feature in the app to create great Client experiences.</li>
            <li>Be reliable: This one’s simple - please do what you say you'll do. Show up on time (or early) and stay until the
                job is done. It is critical that you complete all the HS that you take on and deliver the best service possible.</li>
            <li>Treat HLO like your business: As you know, HLO is a platform to grow your own business. Delivering great experiences
                will result in even more work for you. Ask yourself what will make this Client want to hire you again and deliver
                an experience that matches those expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following sections provide more detail on what we expect from you as a Caregiver. Please be aware that violation of these
            guidelines may result in reduced access to HS opportunities or outright removal from the HLO Community.
        </p>
        <h3>The 3 pillars of Caregiver Success are:</h3>
        <h4>Responsivenes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsivenes is critical to your success as a Caregiver. We set expectations with our Clients that Caregivers will
                respond to a HS invitation within 30 minutes, so reply as promptly as possible.</li>
            <li>If you are on a HS and you receive an invitation, let your current Client know that you will be responding to the
                invitation and then return immediately to the current HS.</li>
            <li>Do not leave a Client waiting for your reply to a message in the chat thread. A prompt and clear reply is important
                to Client satisfaction. Please closely manage chat threads for all HS you have been invited to.</li>
            <li>HS invitations need to be accepted and scheduled or forfeited as quickly as possible. Failure to take the appropriate
                action on a HS invitation can result in a policies violation or removal from the HLO Community.</li>
            <li>Your Caregiver account may be paused if we notice a significant period of inactivity (no closed or accepted HS over
                90 days). If this happens, please visit HealthyLovedOnes.com/orientations to see any upcoming orientation sessions.
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Professionalism</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HLO is a Community for professionals looking to create positive Client experiences. Any unprofessional behavior impacts
                the entire Community and will not be tolerated.</li>
            <li>Some tips to demonstrate professionalism: Use your real name and a recent professional photo that includes your face
                on your profile.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>High-Quality Work</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Only accept HS that you have the time, qualifications and tools to complete. Understand the location of the HS, the
                expectations of the Client and complete your HS in a manner consistent with these expectations.</li>
            <li>When scheduling HS, be sure to leave enough time between HS for traveling, traffic or any other issues that may arise.</li>
            <li>Don’t accept HS that you feel ill-equipped to handle and avoid performing low-quality work on a HS.</li>
            <li>Perform all HS yourself. You may not outsource your HS to a third party, company or competitor under any circumstance.</li>
            <li>If you require additional help on a HS, it is critical that the person also be an approved Caregiver. This is for
                your and the Client's safety. If anything goes wrong on a HS, whether or not it was associated with the actions
                of someone who is not an approved Caregiver, they (and you) may not covered by the HLO $10M Insurance Guarantee.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Nitty-gritty on Homecare Servicing Procedures</h3>
        <p>
            Ok, so what do the pillars of Caregiver success look like in action? This section outlines how you should conduct your business
            on the HLO platform.
        </p>
        <h4>Accepting invitations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>We provide tools for you to tell us the types of HS you are willing to do, at what times, in what areas and at what
                hourly rate. We expect you to accept HS invitations that fall within the boundaries that you’ve set.</li>
            <li>Clients invest time and effort in selecting a specific Caregiver which is why accepting every HS invitation you receive
                is very important. A Client specifically asked to work with you.</li>
            <li>A low invitation acceptance rate is grounds for reduced access to HS opportunities or removal from the HLO Community.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Forfeiting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Forfeiting a HS can quickly turn a great opportunity into a negative Client experience. HS forfeiting should be a
                last resort and only reserved for extenuating circumstances.</li>
            <li>Some legitimate reasons for forfeiting a HS include: believing you cannot deliver a high-quality experience for the
                Client, not having the proper tools for the HS, or feeling unsafe about a HS. Scheduling conflicts are not considered
                a legitimate reason for forfeiting a HS given the schedule management tools we provided.</li>
            <li>Frequent forfeiting may result in reduced access to HS opportunities, or outright removal from, the HLO Community.</li>
            <li>If a Client cancels a HS within 12 hours of the scheduled time, you may be eligible for 1 hour of payment. Please
                email info@healthylovedones.comfor more information regarding this policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Available Homecare Services</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Available HS are a great way to pick up HS quickly, fill openings in your schedule and build Client relationships.</li>
            <li>Hourly rates on an Available HS are non-negotiable, so only accept an Available HS if you are prepared to perform
                the HS for the stated rate and if you have enough information about the HS from the HS description. Attempts
                to renegotiate the hourly rate on an Available HS is grounds for reduced access to HS opportunities or removal
                from the HLO Community.</li>
            <li>Acceptance is a commitment to perform the HS:</li>
            <li>Only accept Available HS if you feel confident that you will complete the HS.</li>
            <li>If the HS details do not include enough information to provide you this confidence, do not accept the HS.</li>
            <li>Do not accept an Available HS that you are unsure of the time, date and/or location. If you pick up an Available
                HS that you cannot complete due to these reasons, it may be grounds for immediate removal from the community.</li>
            <li>Do not impose hourly minimums, travel time or travel expenses on the Client when you accept an Available HS.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Hourly rates and negotiations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In your profile you have the ability to set your hourly rate for different HS types. These hourly rates are considered
                a commitment to the Community and Clients take them into consideration when inviting you to a HS. They are non-negotiable
                once a HS is assigned.</li>
            <li>We encourage you to regularly review your rates to ensure that they are commensurate with your skill level, experience
                and availability.</li>
            <li>If you believe a HS has been miss-categorized or the Client has been dishonest in dealings, you can forfeit the invitation
                and select the “Client’s needs are unrealistic” or “HS may be fraudulent / unsafe” forfeit reasons.</li>
            <li>Attempts to negotiate your hourly rate after receiving an invitation is considered a violation of Client trust and
                is grounds for reduced access to HS opportunities or outright removal from the HLO Community.</li>
            <li>Once the HS is complete, be sure to invoice your Client within 24 hours of the work being finished. If there is an
                issue that needs to be resolved before you submit the invoice, contact Member Services via info@healthylovedones.comor
                at (852) 9460-6840.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Expenses and reimbursements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Before performing a HS, set appropriate expectations with the Client about out-of-pocket expenses. If not managed
                appropriately, seeking payment for out-of-pocket expenses and reimbursements can result in a bad Client experience,
                negative Caregiver ratings or a policies violation. </li>
            <li>It is safe to assume you will be reimbursed for any purchases you make on behalf of a Client as part of a HS (e.g.
                groceries or a food delivery).</li>
            <li>Do not ask Clients to reimburse for transportation time or costs (tolls, gas, parking) associated with a HS unless
                the HS involves travel outside of your defined work area (you can change this at any time) or excessive transportation.
                If there are significant costs associated with serving a particular area (e.g. bridge tolls), please take that
                into consideration when setting your work area and hourly rates in your profile. You can update your preferred
                work area and rates at any time via your profile.</li>
            <li>If the HS involves travel outside of your work area or excessive transportation (10+ stops), set reimbursement expectations
                with the Client in advance of performing the HS. This gives the Client adequate time to cancel the HS and seek
                a replacement if they so choose.</li>
            <li>If you purchase a tool or supplies for a particular job, do not expect to be reimbursed for that purchase. If you
                do want to be reimbursed for that purchase, be upfront with the Client and consider the purchase to be the property
                of the Client.</li>
            <li>To protect yourself and the HLO Community, be careful about accepting HS that include the purchase of high-value
                items (over HKD2000). Always contact HLO Member Services via info@healthylovedones.comor at (852) 9460-6840 when
                presented with these HSs even if you have worked for the Client before. Member Services can help you verify that
                the HS is legitimate, safe and ensure your reimbursement for the purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Safety</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Above all else, your safety and well-being are our top priority. If, for any reason, you feel unsafe or uncomfortable,
                please professionally and politely leave the HS and remove yourself from the situation. Call HLO Member Services
                as soon as possible. If necessary, call the local authorities first.</li>
            <li>Do not complete any HS that put you at risk financially or physically. This includes meeting a Client for a delivery
                under suspicious circumstances.</li>
            <li>Please follow all guidelines, laws and restrictions for any shops, restaurants, sites or venues you visit or utilize
                during your HS.</li>
            <li>If you require additional help on a HS, it is critical that the person also be an approved Caregiver. This is for
                the safety of you and your Client. If anything goes wrong on a HS as a result of the actions of someone who is
                not an approved Caregiver, they (and you) may not covered by the HLO $10M Insurance Guarantee.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Urgent Issues and HLO Member Services</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HLO Member Services is here to help. If you are having any issues with a HS that is in-progress or soon to happen,
                please contact our Members Services Team at (852) 9460-6840 and select the option for “Emergency Issues”. Please
                respect that this is an emergency line. Any issues that are not extremely time sensitive or urgent should be
                referred to help@healthylovedones.com</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Performance Standards Compliance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure a high-quality HH Servicing experience, we hold all of our Caregivers to the following standards:</li>
            <li>Accept 75% of the HS invitations sent to you;</li>
            <li>Complete 85% of the HSs you agree to take on;</li>
            <li>Quickly respond to HS invitations within 30 minutes or less;</li>
            <li>High return rate of your Clients to HLO after completing a HS with you.</li>
            <li>If you fall in the bottom 10% of Caregivers on any of these metrics for a 30 day period, you may no longer be shown
                in search results or your account may be put into Performance Standards Probation. If your performance standards
                do not improve in the following 30 day period, you’ll have reduced access to HS for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>What exactly is Performance Standards Probation?</li>
            <li>First Account Pause: If we notice a low HS acceptance or completion rate, we’ll pause your access to HS invitations.
                You’ll be required to participate in a Caregiver Performance Improvement module to regain access to HS invitations.
                Elite Caregivers will immediately lose their Elite status.</li>
            <li>Second Account Pause: If we continue to notice a low HS acceptance or completion rate, we’ll pause your access to
                HS invitations again. Reinstatement will require completion of a second Performance Improvement module to regain
                access to invitations. </li>
            <li>Third Account Pause: If after completing two education sessions, your acceptance and completion rates have not improved,
                you may lose all Caregiver privileges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            <em>Please note that direct violations of HLO policy and unprofessional behavior may result in immediate removal from
                the HLO Community. </em>
        </h4>
        <h4>What not to do:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t bail on a HS, without prior communication and approval from the Client or HLO.</li>
            <li>Don’t cancel last minute; this provides a poor experience for the Client.</li>
            <li>Don’t show up to a HS location for a HS you are not assigned to.</li>
            <li>Don’t show up late for HS or missing agreed-upon timelines for HS.</li>
            <li>Don’t attempt to renegotiate the hourly rate on a HS you’ve been invited to or an Available HS you’ve accepted.</li>
            <li>Don’t complete a HS with poor quality work.</li>
            <li>Don’t display unprofessional or unbecoming communication or behavior in any form.</li>
            <li>Don’t contact a Client regarding a negative review, accept a reduced payment or forfeit a payment in exchange for
                a positive review or to avoid a negative review.</li>
            <li>Don’t contact third parties related to or regarding a Client including, but not limited to, a Client’s friends, family,
                and place of employment or attempt to damage a Client’s reputation on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter,
                LinkedIn and Yelp.</li>
            <li>Don’t attempt to damage the reputation of HLO on social media platforms including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter,
                LinkedIn and Yelp.</li>
            <li>Don’t attempt to bill a Client for a HS that should have been canceled, has not been finished or completed to their
                satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Don’t invoice a Client for travel time to or from the HS location. The time that you can invoice a Client for begins
                when you get the first location of a HS.</li>
            <li>Don’t ignore communications from HLO Support Teams (Member Services, Policies, and Resolutions). We expect all Caregivers
                to respond within 48 hours to email and phone call communications.</li>
            <li>Don’t violate the spirit of payments on the HLO platform in any way to facilitate an “off platform” payment, including
                but not limited to:</li>
            <li>Accepting a payment outside of the platform.</li>
            <li>Billing for fewer hours than actually worked.</li>
            <li>Billing for more hours than actually worked.</li>
            <li>Billing for hours worked in the reimbursement section.</li>
            <li>Giving a Client your contact information (phone number, email address or website).</li>
            <li>Canceling a HS that has been completed.</li>
            <li>Don’t provide poor quality work which is measured by:</li>
            <li>Poor ratings and/or reviews.</li>
            <li>Client communication to HLO Member Services.</li>
            <li>A high cancellation rate.</li>
            <li>A high forfeiture rate.</li>
            <li>Unresponsiveness to Clients on invitations.</li>
            <li>Any other criteria, which may lead to a poor experience for a Client.</li>
        </ul>

                To preserve the integrity of the HLO Community, we have a zero tolerance policy for any of these behaviors. All of these
