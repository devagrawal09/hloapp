       <p> HealthyLovedOnes is a social enterprise with a non-profit charity component.  We believe neighbors can help neighbors, we want to empower people so that they can be part of the solution and change the world, one person at a time.</p>

<p> What pain/problem do we solve?  Big picture/macro level - less stress and worry in your life.  Your health and the health of your Loved Ones is a big deal.  If you have problems in this area believe me it comes with stress and worry.  Your job is to deal with it.  Thus our tag line – Making life easier for you. </p>

<p> We’re not doctors or a hospital, we call them the first mile of healthcare.  Homecare and Caregivers (family, friends, and helpers) is what we call the last mile of healthcare.  At HLO, we specialize in the last mile.</p>

<p>What happens at home is super important.  Be it Eldercare, Childcare, Babycare, Special Needs Care, Rehab Care, Everyday and Lastminute Care, having the right people to care for yourself or your Loved Ones is the key to quality of life.  Is quality of life important to you?</p>

<p>Who is the right person?  It’s different for everyone just like love, but we believe it comes down to having the right attitude and aptitude, we call this the TLC spirit. </p>

<p>Attitude means they are positive and happy.  Aptitude means they have a big heart and wants to be of service and pay it forward.  We’re looking for real Social Heroes, we don’t discriminate and believe in second chances and new beginnings. </p>
